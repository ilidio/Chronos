# Chronos History

**Comprehensive history management for VS Code.**

Chronos History provides a robust safety net by automatically tracking local snapshots of your work, independent of Git. Effortlessly restore previous versions or use specialized Git views to trace history for specific code selections.

## 📖 Features & Usage

Access all features via the context menu (right-click) in your editor or explorer:

```text
Chronos History
 ├─ Show History              (File-specific timeline)
 ├─ Show History for Selection (History for selected lines)
 ├───────────────────────────
 ├─ Git History for Selection  (Git commits for selected lines)
 ├───────────────────────────
 ├─ Show Project History      (Global timeline of all changes)
 ├─ Show Recent Changes       (Quick view of latest modifications)
 ├─ Put Label                 (Create a named checkpoint)
```

### 🛠 Detailed Menu Reference

#### 1. Show History
**The File-specific "Time Machine".**
This opens a timeline of every automatic snapshot taken for the **currently active file**. Use this when you want to see how a specific file has evolved over the last few hours or days, compare versions side-by-side, or restore the file to a previous state.

#### 2. Show History for Selection (Chronos History)
**A local "Time Machine" for your uncommitted work.**
This is unique to the Chronos extension. It tracks changes locally on your machine, completely independent of Git.
*   **How it works:** It filters your local Chronos snapshots to find only those where the selected lines were modified.
*   **What it shows:** A timeline of your local edits (auto-saves) that affected that specific block of code.
*   **Use case:** Ideal for tracking your own thought process during a coding session, undoing a specific change you made 10 minutes ago, or recovering a deleted block of logic that you haven't committed to Git yet.

#### 3. Git History for Selection
**The direct equivalent to JetBrains' "Show History for Selection".**
This feature integrates deeply with Git to track the evolution of specific lines of code, even if you haven't been running this extension.
*   **How it works:** It runs a `git log -L` command on the selected lines.
*   **What it shows:** It displays a list of every Git commit that touched those lines, showing the author, date, and commit message.
*   **Use case:** Perfect for seeing *who* changed a specific function and *why* (via the commit message), or tracking a bug back to its introduction years ago.

#### 4. Show Project History
**The Global Activity Feed.**
This provides a bird's-eye view of changes across your **entire workspace**. It lists snapshots from all files, sorted chronologically. This is useful for answering the question: *"What was I working on yesterday across the whole project?"*

#### 5. Show Recent Changes
**The "What just happened?" view.**
A streamlined, high-priority view of the most recent modifications. While Project History shows a long timeline, Recent Changes is optimized for quick context switching—helping you remember the last few files you touched before a break or a meeting.

#### 6. Put Label
**Manual Checkpoints.**
Chronos takes snapshots automatically, but sometimes you want to mark a specific moment (e.g., *"Right before the big API refactor"* or *"Stable build before test"*). Putting a label creates a **named bookmark** in your timeline, making it easy to find and revert to that specific version later.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Tune the extension in **Settings** (`Cmd+,` -> search `chronos`):

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `chronos.enabled` | `true` | Turn the entire system on/off. |
| `chronos.maxDays` | `30` | Days to keep history before pruning. |
| `chronos.exclude` | `node_modules`, ... | Folders to ignore. |
| `chronos.saveInProjectFolder` | `false` | If true, saves history in `.history/` inside your project (sharable). |

## 🛡️ Data & Privacy
**Your code stays yours.** All history is stored locally on your machine (in VS Code's global storage or your project folder). No data is ever sent to any server.
